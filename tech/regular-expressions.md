# Regular expressions

## What it is

A **regular expression** (regex) is a short pattern that describes a family of texts, used to find or pull out pieces of text. `Execution Time: ([\d.]+) ms` describes "the words `Execution Time: `, then some digits and dots, then ` ms`", and can hand back the digits. Python has them in the standard library module `re`.

## Why this repository uses it

The lesson reads query plans: the text that `EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, BUFFERS)` prints. The numbers it needs (the time, the pages, the node types, which index) are in lines of fixed shape, so a handful of regular expressions pulls them out. The same patterns read the committed `.txt` plans, which is how the tests check the README's claims.

## Where it appears

| File | Patterns |
|---|---|
| `domain/plan.py` | `_EXECUTION`, `_BUFFERS`, `_PAGE_COUNTS`, `_NODE`, `_INDEX`, `_REMOVED`, `_HEAP_FETCHES` |
| `domain/write_cost.py` | `_WAL`, `_EXECUTION` |

## How it works underneath

**Matching.** The regex engine tries the pattern at each position of the text, left to right, and reports the first place where the whole pattern fits. `re.search(pattern, text)` returns a *match object* (or `None` if nothing fits). `pattern.findall(text)` returns every match.

**Building blocks.**

| Piece | Meaning |
|---|---|
| a plain character, e.g. `a` or `:` | itself |
| `.` | any one character except a line break |
| `\d` | one digit 0 to 9 |
| `\w` | one letter, digit or underscore |
| `\s` | one space, tab or line break |
| `[abc]` | one of the characters listed; `[a-z]` a range; `[\d.]` a digit or a dot (a dot inside brackets is just a dot); `[^x]` anything but x |
| `*` | the previous piece zero or more times |
| `+` | one or more times |
| `?` | zero or one time |
| `+?` and `*?` | the same, but as few as possible ("lazy") |
| `(...)` | a **group**: remembers the text it matched, available as `match.group(1)`; with `findall`, a pattern with one group returns the group's text |
| `(?:...)` | a group for structure only, remembers nothing |
| `a|b` | a or b |
| `^` and `$` | start and end of the text, or of each line with `re.MULTILINE` |
| `\` before a symbol | the symbol itself, e.g. `\(` is a bracket |

**Raw strings.** Write patterns as `r"..."`. In a raw string a backslash is kept as typed, so `r"\d"` is the two characters `\d` that the regex engine wants. Without `r`, Python would try to read `\d` itself.

**Compiling.** `re.compile(pattern)` prepares the pattern once so it can be reused; module-level constants named `_NAME` hold them.

**Flags.** `re.MULTILINE` makes `^` match at the start of every line.

**Limits.** A regex reads text, not structure. It is a good fit for reading the fixed shapes of lines printed by a program; it is a poor fit for nested formats like HTML.

## Walkthrough of this repository's use

The plan that the examples read (`sql/explain/q1_day_before.txt`):

```text
Seq Scan on orders  (cost=0.00..78758.28 rows=5003 width=457) (actual time=0.455..830.145 rows=2748.00 loops=1)
  Filter: (date(created_at) = '2026-03-14'::date)
  Rows Removed by Filter: 997252
  Buffers: shared hit=2058 read=61692
  I/O Timings: shared read=448.925
Planning Time: 0.130 ms
Execution Time: 831.496 ms
```

`src/slow_queries/domain/plan.py`, lines 16 to 22:

```python
_EXECUTION = re.compile(r"Execution Time: ([\d.]+) ms")
_BUFFERS = re.compile(r"Buffers: shared (.*)")
_PAGE_COUNTS = re.compile(r"(?:hit|read)=(\d+)")
_NODE = re.compile(r"^\s*(?:->\s*)?([A-Z][A-Za-z ]+?)(?: using \w+| on \w+| \(cost)", re.MULTILINE)
_INDEX = re.compile(r"(?:using|Bitmap Index Scan on) (\w+)")
_REMOVED = re.compile(r"Rows Removed by Filter: (\d+)")
_HEAP_FETCHES = re.compile(r"Heap Fetches: (\d+)")
```

- `_EXECUTION = re.compile(r"Execution Time: ([\d.]+) ms")` matches the last line. `Execution Time: ` is literal text. `([\d.]+)` is a group of one or more characters that are digits or dots; it captures `831.496`. ` ms` is literal. `search` finds the line anywhere in the text; `group(1)` is `831.496`.
- `_BUFFERS = re.compile(r"Buffers: shared (.*)")` matches `Buffers: shared hit=2058 read=61692` and captures everything after `shared ` to the end of the line (`.*`): `hit=2058 read=61692`.
- `_PAGE_COUNTS = re.compile(r"(?:hit|read)=(\d+)")` finds `hit=2058` and `read=61692`. `(?:hit|read)` means "hit or read" without remembering which; `=` is literal; `(\d+)` captures the digits. `findall` on the Buffers text returns `['2058', '61692']`. The function `pages_touched` adds them: 63,750 pages.
- `_NODE = re.compile(r"^\s*(?:->\s*)?([A-Z][A-Za-z ]+?)(?: using \w+| on \w+| \(cost)", re.MULTILINE)` finds the name of each plan step. With `re.MULTILINE`, `^` matches at the start of every line. `\s*` skips leading spaces. `(?:->\s*)?` is an optional arrow: child steps in a plan start with `->`. `([A-Z][A-Za-z ]+?)` captures a capital letter followed by letters and spaces, as few as possible (`+?` is lazy). The last group `(?: using \w+| on \w+| \(cost)` says what must follow the name: ` using index_name`, ` on table_name` or ` (cost`. For the line above, it captures `Seq Scan`, because ` on orders` follows. Notes such as `Filter:` do not match, since the colon is not a letter or space.
- `_INDEX = re.compile(r"(?:using|Bitmap Index Scan on) (\w+)")` captures the name after `using` (index scans, index-only scans) or after `Bitmap Index Scan on`.
- `_REMOVED = re.compile(r"Rows Removed by Filter: (\d+)")` captures `997252`.
- `_HEAP_FETCHES = re.compile(r"Heap Fetches: (\d+)")` captures the number of table visits of an index-only scan.

`src/slow_queries/domain/write_cost.py`, lines 13 to 14:

```python
_WAL = re.compile(r"WAL: records=(\d+).* bytes=(\d+)")
_EXECUTION = re.compile(r"Execution Time: ([\d.]+) ms")
```

- `_WAL = re.compile(r"WAL: records=(\d+).* bytes=(\d+)")` reads a line like `WAL: records=20357 fpi=3 bytes=5947011` (PostgreSQL prints the `fpi=` part only when it is not zero, so the line may also be `WAL: records=20357 bytes=5947011`): it captures the number after `records=`, then `.*` skips anything that is in between (here `fpi=3`, or nothing), then captures the number after ` bytes=`. Group 1 is the record count and group 2 the byte count.
- `_EXECUTION` is the same pattern as in `plan.py`.

How the functions use them: `execution = _EXECUTION.search(text)` and `float(execution.group(1))`; `_REMOVED.findall(text)` returns every count and `sum(...)` adds them (a plan may have several filters).

## Try it yourself

1. `.venv/bin/python -c "import re; print(re.search(r'Execution Time: ([\d.]+) ms', open('sql/explain/q1_day_before.txt').read()).group(1))"` prints `831.496` (or the figure in your current file).
2. `.venv/bin/python -c "import re; print(re.findall(r'(?:hit|read)=(\d+)', 'hit=2058 read=61692'))"` prints `['2058', '61692']`. (Applied to the whole plan file the pattern would also find the `read=448` of the `I/O Timings` line; that is why `pages_touched` applies it only to the text of the `Buffers:` lines.)
3. `.venv/bin/python -c "from slow_queries.domain.plan import _NODE; print(_NODE.findall(open('sql/explain/q3_listing_after.txt').read()))"` prints `['Index Only Scan']`.
4. `.venv/bin/python -c "import re; print(re.search(r'Execution Time: (\d+) ms', open('sql/explain/q1_day_before.txt').read()))"` prints `None`: without the dot in the character class, `\d+` cannot match `831.496` followed by ` ms`.

## Mistakes people make

- Forgetting the `r` prefix and having backslashes eaten by Python.
- Forgetting that `.` also matches a literal dot only by accident; to mean a dot, write `\.` (or `[.]`).
- Greedy matching more than intended (`.*` runs to the end of the line; `.*?` stops early).
- Using `match` (anchored at the start) where `search` was meant.
- Patterns that become unreadable; split them into named constants and test them.
- Using regex for the wrong job: JSON has `json.loads`.

**How this repository avoids them.** Patterns are compiled once as named constants; every pattern has a unit test with a realistic plan fragment (`tests/unit/domain/test_plan.py`); a plan without the expected line raises `PlanParseError` with a message instead of returning zero. JSON plans are read with real JSON parsing, not with regular expressions.

## Check yourself

1. What does `\d+` match? *One or more digits in a row.*
2. What is the difference between `(...)` and `(?:...)`? *The first remembers the matched text as a group; the second only groups.*
3. What does `findall` return for a pattern with one group? *A list of the texts matched by that group, one per match.*
4. Why write `r"\d"`? *A raw string keeps the backslash, so the regex engine receives `\d` intact.*
5. How do you match a literal dot? *`\.` or `[.]`.*
